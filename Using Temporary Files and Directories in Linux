Using Temporary Files and Directories in Linux
Retrieve and Unpack the Archive
List the current working directory:
pwd
Change to the /tmp directory:
cd /tmp
Use wget to retrieve the file:
wget https://github.com/mscjr/LA/raw/master/RH342/sosreport-ip-10-0-1-11-2019-03-22-wxoxhnk.tar.xz
List the contents of the /tmp directory:
ls
Unpack the archive, and disregard any error messages that appear:
tar xf sosreport-ip-10-0-1-11-2019-03-22-wxoxhnk.tar.xz
Verify that this was successful:
ll
Create a Temporary File from the Directory Listing
Create a temporary file:
tmp_file=$(mktemp)
Verify that this was successful:
echo $tmp_file
Create a temporary file from a recursive directory listing of the archive folder:
ls -R sosreport-ip-10-0-1-11-2019-03-22-wxoxhnk/ >> $tmp_file
Verify that this was successful:
cat $tmp_file
Move the version.txt File to a More Persistent Temporary Directory
Change to the sosreport-ip-10-0-1-11-2019-03-22-wxoxhnk folder:
cd sosreport-ip-10-0-1-11-2019-03-22-wxoxhnk
List the contents of the folder:
ls
Change back to the /tmp directory:
cd ..
Move the version.txt file to /var/tmp:
mv sosreport-ip-10-0-1-11-2019-03-22-wxoxhnk/version.txt /var/tmp
Verify that this was successful:
ll /var/tmp/version.txt
