Querying DNS Client Configuration from the Command Line

Introduction
In this hands-on lab, weâ€™ll verify the network DNS configuration settings and perform several DNS queries. Knowing how to locate this information, and how to perform queries using the configured DNS host (as well as other hosts), is a useful skill.
We have been asked to troubleshoot an issue with www.acloudguru.com. One of the developers is having trouble reaching the host from this server, and has asked us to verify connectivity.
Solution
Connect to the lab server using the credentials provided:
ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Determine the Configured DNS Host
Verify the DNS host of the server:
cat /etc/resolv.conf
Perform a DNS Lookup of www.acloudguru.com Using the Configured DNS Server
Perform a DNS lookup using host:
host www.acloudguru.com
Perform a DNS lookup using dig:
dig www.acloudguru.com
Perform a DNS Lookup of www.acloudguru.com Using Another DNS Host
Perform a DNS lookup using another DNS host with dig:
dig @1.1.1.1 www.acloudguru.com
 Note: The connection is expected to fail with the following message, "connection timed out; no servers could be reached."
Perform a DNS lookup using another DNS host with host:
host www.acloudguru.com 1.1.1.1
 Note: The connection is expected to fail with the following message, "connection timed out; no servers could be reached."
Test Connectivity to www.acloudguru.com
Test connectivity using ping:
ping -c1 www.acloudguru.com
 Note: The ping statistics will show 100% packet loss.
Test connectivity using curl:
curl -I www.acloudguru.com
 Note: The output will indicate 301 Moved Permanently.
