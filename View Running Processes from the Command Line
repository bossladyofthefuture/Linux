View Running Processes from the Command Line

Determine How Many Processes Are Currently Running
Run the following command:
ps aux | grep -v grep | wc -l
The command should return the number of processes running on the system.
Determine the Current System Load
Run the following command:
cat /proc/loadavg
The command should return the current system load.
Determine How Many Processes Are Running as cloud_user
Run the following command:
ps -U cloud_user | wc -l
The command should return the number of processes running as cloud_user.
Determine the PID of the xfce4-session Process
Run the following command:
ps aux | grep xfce4-session | grep -v grep
The command should return a value for the PID.
Determine How Many Threads the xfce4-session Process Is Using
Run the following command, replacing <PID_VALUE> with the PID value from the objective above (the numerical value returned in the output, after cloud_u+):
cat /proc/<PID_VALUE>/status | grep Threads
You should get a return of 3 threads.
Write a Small Shell Script that Returns the Number of Threads a Process Is Running (Optional)
Make a new directory named bin by running the following command:
mkdir bin
Create the file threads.sh in the bin directory by running the following command:
vim bin/threads.sh
In the Vim text editor, enter the following:
Note: When copying and pasting code into Vim from the lab guide, first enter :set paste (and then i to enter insert mode) to avoid adding unnecessary spaces and hashes. To save and quit the file, press Escape followed by :wq. To exit the file without saving, press Escape followed by :q!.
#!/bin/bash 


if [ -n $1 ] 
then 
_pid=$(ps aux | grep -E "$1\$" | grep -v grep | grep -v threads.sh | awk '{print $2}') 
cat /proc/$_pid/status | grep Threads 


fi
Press Esc to exit Insert mode, and type :wq to save and exit the file.
Make the file executable, by running the following command:
chmod u+x bin/threads.sh
Use the script we just created to determine the number of threads the xfce4-session process is running.
./bin/threads.sh xfce4-session
You should get a return of 3 threads.
